# numGuess.Py Game

**Description:** numGuess is a number guessing game developed in Python. Players try to guess a secret number within a given range and earn a score based on the number of attempts. The game features different difficulty levels and saves high scores. It also supports both rich-text and plain-text modes depending on the availability of dependencies.
## Features

- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose between Easy (1-100) and Hard (1-1000).
- **High Scores:** Save and display high scores with timestamps.
- **Hints:** Receive hints based on your guesses.
- **Interactive Console UI:** Provides a rich-text interface with color and formatting if dependencies are installed; otherwise, defaults to a plain-text mode.
## Dependencies

- `rich`: For enhanced console output (color, formatting, etc.)
If the `rich` library is not installed, the program will run in a basic text-only mode.
## Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/numGuess.git
  cd numGuess
```

**2. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`. To install the `rich` library:**

```bash
  pip install rich
```
If you do not want to install `rich`, the program will still run in a basic text-only mode without enhanced formatting.
## Usage

Run the game by executing the following command:

```run
python numGuess.py

```

The game will prompt you to enter your name or to check high scores. You can choose to play the game, check high scores, or quit.
